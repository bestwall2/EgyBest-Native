Advanced React Native Movie & Series Streaming App - Development Prompt
Create a complete React Native application for streaming movies and TV series using the TMDB API. Follow these specifications:
Core Requirements
Tech Stack:

React Native (latest stable version)
TypeScript for type safety
React Navigation v6 for routing
Redux Toolkit or Zustand for state management
Axios for API calls
React Query for data fetching and caching
Async Storage for local data persistence

Architecture:

Implement clean architecture with separation of concerns
Organize code into: screens, components, services, hooks, store, types, utils, constants
Use custom hooks for reusable logic
Implement error boundaries for crash handling

TMDB API Integration
Setup:

Create a secure API service layer with interceptors
Store API key securely (use react-native-dotenv)
Implement request/response interceptors for error handling
Add request throttling and caching strategies

Required Endpoints:

Trending movies/TV shows (daily/weekly)
Popular, top-rated, upcoming content
Search movies and TV shows
Genre lists and filtering
Movie/show details with cast, crew, videos
Recommendations and similar content
Multi-season TV show data with episodes
Person details and filmography

Features to Implement
1. Authentication & User Management:

Optional user profiles (local storage)
Watchlist and favorites functionality
Continue watching history
Viewing preferences

2. Home Screen:

Hero banner with trending content
Horizontal scrollable sections: Trending, Popular, Top Rated, By Genre
Skeleton loaders for better UX
Pull-to-refresh functionality
Infinite scroll implementation

3. Browse/Discover:

Filter by: Genre, year, rating, popularity
Sort options
Separate tabs for Movies and TV Shows
Advanced search with filters

4. Detail Screen:

High-quality backdrop and poster images
Title, release date, runtime, rating
Overview/synopsis with read more/less
Cast carousel with profile images
Trailers and clips player
Similar content recommendations
Add to watchlist/favorites buttons
Share functionality
For TV shows: Season selector, episode lists

5. Search:

Real-time search with debouncing
Search history (stored locally)
Multi-category search (movies, TV, people)
Filter search results

6. Video Player Integration:

Integrate react-native-video or expo-video
Play trailers and clips from TMDB
Custom playback controls
Fullscreen support
Picture-in-picture mode (if possible)

7. User Library:

Watchlist tab
Favorites tab
Continue watching section
Viewing history

UI/UX Design
Design System:

Dark theme optimized for media content
Custom color palette with TMDB red (#E50914 style) accents
Consistent typography scale
Reusable component library (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
Smooth animations using React Native Reanimated
Gesture handling with React Native Gesture Handler

Components:

MediaCard (movie/show thumbnail with details)
HorizontalList (scrollable content rows)
DetailsHeader (gradient overlay design)
CastCard (circular profile images)
SearchBar (animated with clear button)
FilterChips (genre selection)
Rating display (stars or percentage)
Loading skeletons matching content layout

Navigation:

Bottom tab navigation (Home, Browse, Search, Library)
Stack navigation for detail screens
Smooth transitions and animations
Deep linking support

Performance Optimization

Image lazy loading with react-native-fast-image
List optimization with FlatList props (windowSize, maxToRenderPerBatch)
Memoization for expensive renders
Code splitting where applicable
Bundle size optimization
Reduce unnecessary re-renders

Data Management

Implement pagination for all lists
Cache API responses with React Query (staleTime, cacheTime)
Offline support for cached data
Optimistic updates for watchlist/favorites
Data normalization in state

Error Handling & Edge Cases

Network error handling with retry logic
Empty states for lists
Loading states (skeleton screens)
Error boundaries for component crashes
Form validation
API rate limiting handling
No results found states

Additional Features

Push notifications (optional)
App rating prompt
Share content to social media
Multi-language support (i18n)
Accessibility features (screen reader support)
Analytics integration points

Code Quality

ESLint and Prettier configuration
TypeScript strict mode
Comprehensive prop types/interfaces
Reusable utility functions
Constants file for magic numbers
Environment variables for API keys
Comments for complex logic

Testing Considerations

Structure code for testability
Separate business logic from UI
Mock service layer for testing
Add test IDs for E2E testing

Deliverables

Complete source code with TypeScript
Package.json with all dependencies
Environment setup instructions
README with setup and API key configuration
Comments explaining complex logic
Reusable components documented

Notes

Use TMDB's image CDN for optimal image loading
Implement proper image sizing (w500, w780, original)
Handle adult content filtering
Respect TMDB attribution requirements
Consider platform-specific code for iOS/Android differences

Build this as a production-ready MVP that can be extended with additional features like actual streaming, user accounts, or premium content.
